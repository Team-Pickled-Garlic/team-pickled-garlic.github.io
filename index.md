## Overview 

iCalendar is the standard for "calendar data exchange" ([RFC 5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)).
This standard is sometimes referred to as "iCal", an Apple calendar software of the same name (see iCal). 
This software is also an implementation of this standard.
iCalendar allows users to send "meeting requests" or "tasks" via email. 
Recipients can easily respond to the sender, accept the request, or propose a new meeting time by using the iCalendar email client.
iCalendar is supported by many products. 
Normally, iCalendar data is exchanged using email, but it can also be used independently and is not limited to a certain transmission protocol.

## Plans
* Week 7: The second check-in is worth 5 points. You will demonstrate to the TA
that:
• At least minimally functioning code that does something: You must
demonstrate code, even if it is just print statements, that generates a .ics file
for a simple, single occurrence event: Study for exam, 10am-1pm HST, 13
March 2020, in Hamilton Library. You must then demonstrate that the
calendar program of your choice (say, google calendar) successfully reads
and processes your .ics file.
• Assuming your are taking an agile approach, your user stories.
• A sketch of the user interface.
• Your current Kanban (or whatever your team decides) board.
* Week 9: The third check-in is worth 5 points. You will demonstrate to the TA that:
• you developing and performing test cases as you are developing code. If you
aren’t doing TDD (test driven development), you must convince the TA that
you have a process of demonstrating correctness
• you have functioning code that does substantially more than it did for the
first check-in. In particular, you must demonstrate a user interface for an
event creation system that uses menus and checks input for validity (i.e., no
30 February events, no events that end before they start, …)
• you have a plan for implementing recurring events
