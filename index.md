## Overview 

iCalendar is the standard for "calendar data exchange" (RFC 5545).
This standard is sometimes referred to as "iCal", an Apple calendar software of the same name (see iCal). 
This software is also an implementation of this standard.
iCalendar allows users to send "meeting requests" or "tasks" via email. 
Recipients can easily respond to the sender, accept the request, or propose a new meeting time by using the iCalendar email client.
iCalendar is supported by many products. 
Normally, iCalendar data is exchanged using email, but it can also be used independently and is not limited to a certain transmission protocol.
