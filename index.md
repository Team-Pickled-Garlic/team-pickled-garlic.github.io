## Overview 

iCalendar is the standard for "calendar data exchange" ([RFC 5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)).
This standard is sometimes referred to as "iCal", an Apple calendar software of the same name (see iCal). 
This software is also an implementation of this standard.
iCalendar allows users to send "meeting requests" or "tasks" via email. 
Recipients can easily respond to the sender, accept the request, or propose a new meeting time by using the iCalendar email client.
iCalendar is supported by many products. 
Normally, iCalendar data is exchanged using email, but it can also be used independently and is not limited to a certain transmission protocol.

## [Milestone 1]
* Team Page
* Schedule page-Create schedule
* 

## [Milestone 2]
* Week 7: The second check-in

• At least minimally functioning code that does something: To demonstrate that the
calendar program of your choice (say, google calendar) successfully reads and processes your .ics file.

• A sketch of the user interface.

• Current Kanban (or whatever your team decides) board.

* Week 9: developing and performing test cases as you are developing code. must convince the TA that we have a process of demonstrating correctness

• Functioning code that does substantially more than it did for the
first check-in. Must demonstrate a user interface for an event creation system that uses menus and checks input for validity (i.e., no
30 February events, no events that end before they start, …)

• To have a plan for implementing recurring events
