# Our Software Engineering Approach
For this project we will be adopting the same approach as we were taught in Professor Philip Johnson's ICS 314 course, Issue Driven Project Management.  

Each week we will decide on a day to either meet face to face or to meet online to discuss what are the goals for the next check-in, as well as other topics such as discussing if parts of the project need to be rethought. When we decide what tasks are to be completed for that check-in period, each task will be made into an issue and placed on the GitHub's kanban project management board. We will attempt to design tasks in such a way that they are not dependent on one another, so that we can work on the project concurrently as a team.  

From the project board each group member will be assigned at least three tasks (tentative) per week. No task is to be worked on concurrently by more than one member. If a group member completes their share for the week they can assign themselves extra tasks if available.  

Each issue will be worked on in its own independent branch. When work for that branch is completed, tested, and functioning as intended the issue will be marked as completed and the issue branch is to be merged into the master branch. Each set of issues are to be completed and merged into the master branch before the corresponding check-in date.
